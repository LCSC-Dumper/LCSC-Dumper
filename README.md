This fish shell script dumps all (I hope) LCSC Parts into machine readable JSON files.

It uses the search API to dump 25 parts at once. I think the rate limit is around 30 per minute so ~ 45k parts per hour with ~500k parts, this could finish in 12 hours.

Please don't use this tool for fun, only when you have a good reason to do so.

See [here](https://github.com/LCSC-Dumper/LCSC-Parts/) for the generated dumps
